Dev Con Sample code for accessing memory cards
===============================================
Dave 

This is not as finished as I would have liked but I'm being pressured to 
move onto other things so I'm distributing it in this state.  If (when)you 
find a bug in it, please leave a message on the bbs and I'll try and fix it.
If you have any suggestion for improvement/modification the same applies. 

This program should allow you to read and write from memory cards whilst 
displaying animated graphics and playing seq data, as well as showing the 
optimum technique for detecting cards.

I know I told everyone not to do this, but......... I was wrong.

Its not doing anything new or clever, it just seems to do everything in the 
right order???

Hope there's not too many lies or red herrings...........














Hi Rod,
   The best routine I have for detecting cards is the one in card.c called 
   test_card()

   This was written for me by an SCE engineer for the developers conf....
   So it should be pretty good.

   Hope this helps.
   
   Dave
