Name   3ds2rsd - Converts 3DS file to PlayStation 3D model data files.
=====

Date  1995/Mar/22  Version 1.0 beta

      Unsupported
====

Syntax
=======

    3ds2rsd [-v] <3DS File>


Example
========
        3ds2rsd foo1.3ds

 This will generats following RSD files in the current directory.

        foo1.rsd, foo1.ply, foo1.mat, foo1.grp


Installation
=============
  1) Set DOS environment variable 3DSDIR to the directory where
     your 3D Studio is installed.

     For instance if you have installted 3D Studio into C:\3ds4,
     then you have to set,

           set 3DDIR=c:\3ds4

  2) Copy "dos4gw.exe" into directory which is one of the seach
     path directories.

  3) Copy "3ds2rsd.exe" into directory where is one of the search
     path directories.


Explanation
===========

 1) The converter tries to converts following inforation in the 3DS file.

     - Geometry
     - Smoothness
     - Color
     - Texturemap UV
     - Semitransparency


 2) You can only use BMP files for texture mapping.
    Otherwise, UV value will be incorect.


 3) BMP files used for texture mapping will be converted into TIM files.


 4) Texture files (namely BMP files) are search along the path you
    have specified as MAP-PATH in your "3ds.set" file.
    Therefore you have to specify the direcotry where "3ds.set" may be found,
    by the 3DSDIR enveiroment variable.


Plan
=====

1) Limitations in the texture file variation will be soon fixed in the next
   "Plug-in" version of the converter.
