                                -----------

This small program sorts the polygons in a TMD by type. With a sorted TMD
polygons of the same type are processed together, resulting in a speed
increase. The speed increase is dependent on how badly sorted the original
TMD was, but can be quite substantial.

Example usage:
tmdsort.exe -o new.tmd old.tmd
