ECO2EXE Version 0.5 By SiLPHEED of Hitmen.

Recently some yaroze executables have turned up that couldn't be converted
with the old version of this tool (apparently a problem with objcopy.exe), so
I decided to release this version I made a while ago that doesn't use objcopy
anymore. Hopefully there won't be any more problems.

INSTRUCTIONS:

'ECO2EXE filename' will convert the given file to a PS-X EXE.
'ECO2EXE -p filename' will convert to PS-X EXE, and patch the exe to work on
a normal playstation. (don't forget to load libps.exe first of course)


Quick greetings in no order to: EZ-O-RAY, BlackBag, Nagra, DANZiG, K-COMM, 
The Roncler Gang, HeroZero, Segmond, Uxorious, and eveyone else in #psxdev.
Let's just hope that '98 will be the year the psx scene really takes off!
