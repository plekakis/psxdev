Killer Cheats V1
++++++++++++++++

this is the complete source for the killer cheats product. It hopefully 
shows how to make the best possible use of the memory card libraries, note 
that there is movement on the screen when accessing the card and there is 
background music being played.  

Actually getting this code to work may be a bit of a pain as it runs from
the emulator.  


Due to constraints of space, you'll need to provide your own TEKKEN.STR
file (cd MAIN.CTI).
